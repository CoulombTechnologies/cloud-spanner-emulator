# Cloud Spanner Emulator

Cloud Spanner Emulator provides application developers with a locally-running,
emulated instance of Cloud Spanner to enable local development and testing.

## How to Build

Cloud Spanner Emulator uses [bazel](https://bazel.build) for building and
dependency resolution. After installing bazel (we maintain support for 2.0,
but other versions may work), simply run:

```bazel build ...```
